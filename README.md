# TELECOM-CUSTOMER-CHURN-ANALYSIS
This project is designed to transition the company's retention strategy from reactive recovery to proactive, data-driven defense. The primary aim is to minimize attrition and maximize Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) by focusing on the highest-risk, highest-value segments.

## Project Objectives:
• Financial Objective: Reduce the 16% Churn Rate to protect the $61.78K in Annual Revenue at Risk.

• Predictive Objective: Build a machine learning model to assign a Churn Risk Score and achieve 80% accuracy in identifying at-risk customers.

• Operational Objective: Prioritize fixing the 20+ Call Failure service threshold, the operational trigger causing significant churn spikes.

• Targeted Objective: Increase the retention rate of the financially-critical 'High Value - Low Engagement' segment.

• Commitment Objective: Implement early-life campaigns to secure contract commitment from the high-volume 'New - High Risk' segment.

• Behavioral Objective: Increase customer service usage (e.g., Frequency of Use) by 15% for high-risk customers to boost loyalty

-	<a href="https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?order=date_added%2Cdesc&search=bank">Dataset</a>

## Key Problems & Questions:
- What attributes are more common among churners than non-churners? Can churn be predicted using the variables in the data?

- What do the overall demographics of the bank's customers look like?

- Is there a difference between German, French, and Spanish customers in terms of account behavior?

- What types of segments exist within the bank's customers?

## Insights from the Bank Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard
- Overall Churn Rate:

The churn rate is 20.37%, meaning around 2,037 customers out of 10,000 have left the bank.
This suggests that while most customers remain, a significant portion is leaving, requiring further investigation.

- Churn by Region:

Germany has the highest churn rate (32%), while Spain (17%) and France (16%) have lower churn rates.
The bank may need to investigate service issues or competition in Germany.
Churn by Gender:

55.92% of churned customers are male, while 44.08% are female.
Males seem to churn at a slightly higher rate, which could indicate different banking preferences or experiences.

- Churn by Credit Type:

Customers with a "Fair" (685) and "Poor" (520) credit rating have the highest churn rates.
Those with "Excellent" (128) and "Very Good" (252) ratings churn less, indicating that financially stable customers are more likely to stay.
The bank may need to provide better financial products or credit-improving programs to retain high-risk customers.

- Churn by Product Ownership:

Customers with 4 products have the highest churn (100), followed by those with 3 products (83).
Customers with only 1 product churn less (28), but they may not be engaged enough with the bank.
The bank should assess whether customers with more products feel dissatisfied or overwhelmed.

- Balance Impact on Churn:

44.4% of churners have a balance, while 55.6% have zero balance.
This suggests that many customers who leave may not actively use their accounts.
The bank could focus on engagement strategies for low-balance customers.

## Conclusion & Recommendations:
- Germany needs attention: Identify and address issues specific to German customers.

- Target at-risk credit segments: Offer better financial management tools for "Fair" and "Poor" credit score customers.

- Improve engagement for multi-product customers: Ensure those with multiple products receive the right support and value.

- Increase retention efforts for Female customers: Analyze why Female customers churn more and adjust services accordingly.

- Encourage balance maintenance: Offer incentives for customers to keep funds in their accounts to boost engagement.
