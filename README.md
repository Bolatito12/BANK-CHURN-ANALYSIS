# BANK-CHURN-ANALYSIS
This project aims to analyze customer churn for a European bank with 10,000 customers and identify key factors driving attrition. The goal is to provide insights that improve retention strategies and optimize decision-making.

## Project Objectives:
•	Measure churn rate and assess retention performance.

•	Identify key churn factors like credit score, balance, and product ownership.

•	Segment customers to understand churn patterns.

•	Predict potential churn and develop targeted retention strategies.

•	Provide data-driven insights to enhance customer loyalty and business growth.

## Data Used:

## Key Problems & Questions:
- What attributes are more common among churners than non-churners? Can churn be predicted using the variables in the data?

- What do the overall demographics of the bank's customers look like?

- Is there a difference between German, French, and Spanish customers in terms of account behavior?

- What types of segments exist within the bank's customers?

## Insights from the Bank Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard
- Overall Churn Rate:

The churn rate is 20.37%, meaning around 2,037 customers out of 10,000 have left the bank.
This suggests that while most customers remain, a significant portion is leaving, requiring further investigation.

- Churn by Region:

Germany has the highest churn rate (32%), while Spain (17%) and France (16%) have lower churn rates.
The bank may need to investigate service issues or competition in Germany.
Churn by Gender:

55.92% of churned customers are male, while 44.08% are female.
Males seem to churn at a slightly higher rate, which could indicate different banking preferences or experiences.

- Churn by Credit Type:

Customers with a "Fair" (685) and "Poor" (520) credit rating have the highest churn rates.
Those with "Excellent" (128) and "Very Good" (252) ratings churn less, indicating that financially stable customers are more likely to stay.
The bank may need to provide better financial products or credit-improving programs to retain high-risk customers.

- Churn by Product Ownership:

Customers with 4 products have the highest churn (100), followed by those with 3 products (83).
Customers with only 1 product churn less (28), but they may not be engaged enough with the bank.
The bank should assess whether customers with more products feel dissatisfied or overwhelmed.

- Balance Impact on Churn:

44.4% of churners have a balance, while 55.6% have zero balance.
This suggests that many customers who leave may not actively use their accounts.
The bank could focus on engagement strategies for low-balance customers.

## Conclusion & Recommendations:
- Germany needs attention: Identify and address issues specific to German customers.

- Target at-risk credit segments: Offer better financial management tools for "Fair" and "Poor" credit score customers.

- Improve engagement for multi-product customers: Ensure those with multiple products receive the right support and value.

- Increase retention efforts for male customers: Analyze why male customers churn more and adjust services accordingly.

- Encourage balance maintenance: Offer incentives for customers to keep funds in their accounts to boost engagement.
